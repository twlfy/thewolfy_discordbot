# TheWølfy - All the Official Releases

#### Version 1.2T (pre-alfa)
###### Several changes

  - The bot activity has been changed from idle status to online and is able to change his activity during playing music and idling
  - .play code optimisation
  - Fixed the raported issue #2 ("the bot is attepting an error converting the youtube link's title [...]")
  - When playing a song, TheWølfy bot is changing his activity and shows a dialog in the text channel with the song name
  - TheWølfy bot is automatically disconnected when the music is at the end
  - Unfortunately, TheWølfy bot can't create queues and can't play playlists yet ! That's why he's disconnecting after the music is about to end, so you can play another song without using .disconnect (see the next line)
  - .disconnect removed, it's unuseful for now and is not a priority !
  - Added About Me description and the profile picture has been changed
  
  I'm trying to make the listening experience as good as possible, so that everything becomes comfortable for you. More changes are on the way focusing just on the FFMPEG library.
  *maintenance mode is still online
